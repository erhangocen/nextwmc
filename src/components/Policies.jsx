          At Western Money Consulting, we are committed to protecting the
          privacy and security of our clients&apos; personal information. This
          Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect the
          personal information of our clients, including information we may
          receive from vendors such as Stripe, PayPal, and Payoneer.
        </p>
        <h3>Collection of Information</h3>
        <p>
          We may collect personal information from our clients, such as name,
          email address, phone number, and payment information when they engage
          our services. We may also collect information about our clients’
          social media accounts and other online profiles, as well as the
          products or services they offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, we may receive personal information from third-party
          vendors, such as Stripe, PayPal, and Payoneer, when processing
          payments for our services.
        </p>
        <h3>Use of Information</h3>
        <p>
          We use the personal information we collect to provide our social media
          marketing services to our clients. This may include creating and
          managing social media accounts, developing and implementing marketing
          campaigns, and providing analysis and reporting on the success of
          these campaigns.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also use the information we collect to communicate with our
          clients about their accounts, to provide support and customer service,
          and to send marketing and promotional materials related to our
          services. Clients may opt-out of receiving such communications at any
          time.
        </p>
        <h3>Disclosure of Information</h3>
        <p>
          We do not sell or rent our clients’ personal information to third
          parties. However, we may share personal information with vendors who
          help us provide our services, such as Stripe, PayPal, and Payoneer, to
          process payments for our services.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also disclose personal information when required by law, such
          as in response to a court order or subpoena, or to protect our rights
          or the rights of our clients.
        </p>
        <h3>Data Security</h3>
        <p>
          We take appropriate measures to ensure the security of our clients’
          personal information, including using encryption and other security
          technologies to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, or
          alteration. We also require all of our vendors to use reasonable
          security measures to protect personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless
          network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we
          strive to protect our clients’ personal information, we cannot ensure
          or warrant the security of any information they transmit to us or from
          our online products or services, and they do so at their own risk.
        </p>
